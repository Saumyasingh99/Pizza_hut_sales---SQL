# Pizza_hut_sales---SQL

My name is Saumya Singh, in this project i have utilized sql queries to solve questions that were related to pizza sales. The primary objective was to analyze data that help improve sales strategies and customer satisfaction. By leveraging various SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions, I was able to identify trends, peak sales periods, and customer preferences. . This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided a deeper understanding of data-driven decision-making in the food industry.
